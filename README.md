# StudentShare

Mobile development application built on android studio using Kotlin.

The concept for the app was to help students in Ireland find rooms that they could share. A bit like daft.ie but focused on students.

There was a version one of this app which can be found [here](https://github.com/Berncat/StudentShareIreland).

The main changes from the previous app are as follows:



| Area | v1 | v2 |
| ---- | -- | -- |
| Persistence | BasicLocal JSON | Firebase |
| Architecture | MVC | MVVM |
| Navigation | Basic Menu | Nav Drawer |
| UX Design| Basic using standard | More pleasing colours and user interactions |
| Auth| Basic using Boolean | Firebase Auth and Google sign in |
| Maps| Basic marker manipulation | Get current location from user & geocoding |
